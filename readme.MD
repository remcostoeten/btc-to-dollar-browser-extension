A extensions whichs scrapes the BTC Value from certain pages on ByBit and converts them to real time dollar value. Currently working on the `Closed P&L` page: https://www.bybit.com/user/assets/order/closed-pnl/inverse. And the modal popup when you're in a long/short and hit the `TP/SL` button and fill in a target. It will create a new line with the scraped bitcoin value and converts it to dollars. 

Still far from perfect and full of bugs.
